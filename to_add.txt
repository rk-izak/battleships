ESSENTIAL:

Add player names as inputs [X]

Add option for adding new ships and giving them UNIQUE names, and lengths  + debug + catch fail cases [X]

Add player move function + checking board (attack, board is shown before player move) [X]

Add prints with game start, win, end and stats [WIP]

Make sure to clear the CLI before next players move so that they dont cheat [WIP]

Add a timer/continue option for next player move [WIP]


ADDITIONAL:

Add scaling (i.e. more/bigger ships == bigger map)

Finish adding the gamemode where players place ships (starting with only odd pieces, then adding even)

Add a better UI (late stage, not needed)

Add an VS Bot option (where the bot always chooses a random position -> can later add some AI and increasing difficulty)

Add more players (i.e. for 4 players the turns would go 1>2>3>4>1 ... etc, when a player gets eliminated lets say 3 the turn goes
1>2>4>1>2>4... and so on, until one player remains)
