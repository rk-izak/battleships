ESSENTIAL:

Add player names as inputs [X]

Add option for adding new ships and giving them UNIQUE names, and lengths  + debug + catch fail cases [X]

Add player move function + checking board (attack, board is shown before player move) [X]

Add prints with game start, win, end, showing ships and stats an [x]

Make sure to clear the CLI before next players move so that they dont cheat [x]

Add a timer/continue option for next player move [x]

Make it so when a player hits, they get to attack again [X]

Add a legend(X means hit, S means ship, M means miss) [X]

Reformat the check if in list into a function(list, message) + divide into scripts [X]

If ship has length 0, tell user its not been added. [X]

Debug that more than 1 ship can be added [X]


!!!
Edge case: [X]
* there might be a situation where a ship cannot be placed in finite runtime 
-> function checks if for the new ship set the board can be filled finitely
quick hotfix -> if a new ship added would make the board be filled in more than 50% -> do not add 

ADDITIONAL:

FOR CUSTOM GAMEMODE -> REMEMBER TO SET player_count/board_size AS INTEGERS!!! [UNFINISHED]\

Make so when players decide to have a rematch, they can change the board size and add ships [WIP] -> laters

SPECIAL ATTACKS -> if you hit 3/5/8 in a row, get a special NUKE attack that hits an area

Add scaling (i.e. more/bigger ships == bigger map) [kinda WIP -> custom gamemode]

Finish adding the gamemode where players place ships (starting with only odd pieces, then adding even)

Add a better UI (late stage, not needed) [WIP]

Add an VS Bot option (where the bot always chooses a random position -> can later add some AI and increasing difficulty)

Add more players (i.e. for 4 players the turns would go 1>2>3>4>1 ... etc, when a player gets eliminated lets say 3 the turn goes
1>2>4>1>2>4... and so on, until one player remains) [kinda WIP]
