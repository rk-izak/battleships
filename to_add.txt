Add option for adding new ships and giving them UNIQUE names, and lengths  + debug + catch fail cases

Finish adding the gamemode where players place ships (starting with only odd pieces, then adding even)

Add player move function (attack, board is shown before player move)

Add prints with game start, win, end

Make sure to clear the CLI before next players move so that they dont cheat 

Add a timer/continue option for next player move

Add scaling (i.e. bigger map == more ships + bigger ships)

Add a better UI (late stage, not needed)
